# react-sass-template

## About this project
This is the very simple template based on create-react-app. I created it for those situations when you need to quickly start a simple React project and you don't have time to set up its structure, linters, sass support and all that kind of stuff. For example, when you need to complete a technical challenge in a job interview and your time is limited to a couple of hours.

This project was created primarily for my own use. Of course, you can use it for your own purposes if you want, but remember that **you do it at your own risk**!

## What's included in this template

- `create-react-app` skeleton.
- `scss` support (based on `CSS Modules`).
- Configured `eslint`, `prettier`, and `stylelint`.
- `prop-types`.
- Some useful mixins and utils.

## How to use it

- Navigate to the main page of this repository.
- Above the file list, click `Use this template` and create your new repo.
- Clone it.

**or**

- Just download the code and start working locally.

**Don't forget to:**
- Run `npm i` to install packages and `npm start` to run the app.
- Change project's name at `package.json`.
- Change title and description at `index.html`.
- (Possibly: change favicon and logo icon files).
- Change name at `manifest.json`.
- Delete (or update this `README`).

## Happy hacking!
